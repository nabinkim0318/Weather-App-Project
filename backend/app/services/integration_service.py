Module: services.integration_service
------------------------------------

This module encapsulates the business logic for integrating external services
such as Google Maps and YouTube APIs. It provides a clean, reusable interface
for querying, processing, and formatting data retrieved from these third-party
platforms to be consumed by the application.

Key Responsibilities:
- Google Maps Integration:
  - Perform geocoding and reverse geocoding operations to convert between
    addresses, place names, and geographic coordinates.
  - Retrieve map data, embed map views, and generate location-based information
    such as nearby points of interest or route details.
  - Handle autocomplete suggestions and fuzzy matching for location input
    validation and enhancement.
  - Manage API keys, rate limits, and authentication securely.
  - Format and sanitize responses to align with internal data models.

- YouTube API Integration:
  - Search for relevant videos based on keywords, location, or user preferences,
    including weather news, city highlights, and travel guides.
  - Retrieve video metadata such as titles, descriptions, thumbnails, and video URLs.
  - Support pagination and filtering of search results.
  - Manage API quota usage and handle authentication securely.
  - Process and normalize API responses for easy frontend consumption.

Error Handling:
- Implement robust error detection and handling for network issues, invalid API
  responses, quota exceedances, and authentication failures.
- Apply retry mechanisms and exponential backoff for transient errors.
- Log all integration calls, errors, and response statuses for monitoring and
  troubleshooting.

Security & Compliance:
- Safeguard API keys and sensitive credentials.
- Comply with third-party API terms of service and usage policies.

Performance:
- Cache frequently accessed data when appropriate to reduce API call volume.
- Optimize request payloads and batch queries to improve efficiency.

Integration Points:
- Called by API route handlers or service layers requiring map or video content.
- Provides formatted data ready for frontend display or further processing.

This module abstracts and isolates all external API complexities,
providing the application with reliable, consistent, and secure access
to Google Maps and YouTube functionalities.
