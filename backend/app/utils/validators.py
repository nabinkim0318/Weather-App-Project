Module: utils.validators
------------------------

This module provides utility functions for validating user inputs and API
request data, ensuring data integrity and correctness before processing. It is
designed to be used across the backend application to perform consistent validation
checks on common data types such as dates, locations, and other domain-specific inputs.

Key Validation Functions:
- validate_date_format(date_str: str) -> bool:
  Validates whether a given string conforms to the expected date format
  (e.g., 'YYYY-MM-DD').
  Returns True if valid, otherwise False or raises a ValidationError.

- validate_date_range(start_date: str, end_date: str) -> bool:
  Ensures the start date is before or equal to the end date, and that both dates
  are valid. Raises an error if the range is illogical or exceeds allowed limits.

- validate_location(location_str: str) -> bool:
  Performs basic syntax checks on the location string (e.g., non-empty,
  allowed characters), and optionally integrates with geocoding services or
  fuzzy matching logic to verify existence or approximate matching of the location.

- validate_temperature(value: float) -> bool:
  Checks that temperature values are within reasonable physical bounds (optional).

- validate_string_length(value: str, max_length: int) -> bool:
  Ensures that input strings do not exceed the maximum allowed length to prevent
  potential buffer overflow or database constraint violations.

Design Principles:
- Functions should raise well-defined ValidationError exceptions when
  inputs are invalid, enabling consistent error handling upstream
  and downstream.
- Avoid complex logic within validators; keep them focused on correctness
  and format checking.
- Facilitate easy integration with API request handlers and service layers.
- Provide clear and descriptive error messages to aid debugging and user feedback.

Usage:
- Import and call validation functions in FastAPI request models, dependency injections,
  or service logic before database operations or external API calls.
- Combine multiple validators as needed for composite input validation.

Benefits:
- Centralizes validation logic for maintainability and reusability.
- Prevents invalid data from propagating into business logic or storage layers.
- Enhances API robustness and user experience by providing immediate feedback
  on bad inputs.
