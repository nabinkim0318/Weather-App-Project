Module: api.integrations
------------------------

This optional module handles integration with third-party services to enrich the Weather App functionality. It provides
FastAPI endpoints for fetching and serving supplementary content such as YouTube videos and map data related to user locations.

Endpoints:
- GET /api/integrations/youtube
    Retrieves relevant YouTube videos based on the userâ€™s location or weather context (e.g., local weather news, city tours).
- GET /api/integrations/map
    Provides map-related data or embeds for the specified location, supporting multiple map providers.
- Additional endpoints may support traffic data, local alerts, or other location-specific integrations.

Key Responsibilities:
- Validate incoming requests for location and query parameters.
- Communicate with external APIs such as YouTube Data API and Google Maps API to fetch relevant content.
- Handle API key management, rate limiting, and error handling for external service calls.
- Process and format responses to suit frontend display requirements.
- Cache frequent queries to reduce latency and API usage costs.
- Gracefully degrade functionality when external services are unavailable.

Integration Points:
- External APIs (YouTube Data API, Google Maps API, OpenStreetMap, etc.)
- Configuration management for API keys and secrets.
- Cache layers or CDN for performance optimization.
- User authentication for personalized content where applicable.

This module extends the Weather App by embedding rich multimedia and geographic content, increasing user engagement and providing contextual information beyond raw weather data.
