"""
Module: models.user
-------------------

This module defines the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) model for the User entity in the
database. It leverages SQLAlchemy (or the chosen ORM framework) to map the User model to
a relational database table, enabling seamless interaction with user-related data.

Key Responsibilities:
- Define the database schema for the User table, including columns, data types, and
  constraints such as primary keys, unique fields, and foreign keys.
- Represent essential user attributes such as:
  - Unique identifier (e.g., user ID)
  - Authentication credentials (e.g., username, hashed password, email)
  - Profile information (e.g., full name, contact details)
  - User preferences/settings relevant to the application
  - Timestamps for account creation and updates (audit fields)
- Establish relationships to other entities where applicable, for example:
  - One-to-many or many-to-many relations with Locations, Weather data, or User settings
- Include validation rules or ORM-level constraints to ensure data integrity.
- Support serialization/deserialization if integrated with Pydantic schemas.

Usage:
- Import and use the User model in CRUD operations, authentication workflows, and API
  endpoint implementations.
- Extend or customize the model to accommodate additional user-related features or
  fields as needed.

Benefits:
- Provides a structured and centralized representation of user data in the application.
- Simplifies database operations via ORM abstractions.
- Enhances maintainability by decoupling database schema from business logic.
- Facilitates secure and efficient user management and data access.
